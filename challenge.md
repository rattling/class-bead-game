1. Design a dice game for a list of players. Each game is a single round with the winner or winners having the highest score from shaking a cup of n dice.
In the case of a tie, the winner can be chosen arbitrarily or by some other method. Use a Python OOP approach, modelling the game, player, cup and die classes. Run some informat tests from the main function so that you run run the script to see the game in action.
