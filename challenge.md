1. Design a dice game for a list of players. Each player has a name and a score. The game consists of a series of rounds. In each round, the players roll a dice and the player(s) with the highest score win(s) the round. The player(s) who win(s) the highest number of rounds the game. Implement the game in Python. You can use the random module to simulate the dice roll. Add a main function that will be called when the script is run. The main function should create a game with 3 players and 6 rounds. The game should print the name of the winner at the end of the game.
